Introduction

Something totally mind-blowing, and bodacious.

Methods
-------

The mean flight distance is \meandistance{}. 


\noindent
Python thinks it is important to report, \pyvar{}.

Results
-------

Equations are good too [@fisher1919xv].

$$\sum_{e}^{2} \mid \frac{\theta}{\lambda}$$


The figure can be referenced in-text ({@fig:flight}).
